# Tumbleseed-Genetic-Network
This is a custom-made evolution-based artifical intelligence designed to learn to play my own version of the video game Tumbleseed.

This repository comes equipped with the code for the artificial intelligence as well as my rendition of the game. Over time, the AI will learn to play the game.
